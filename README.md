Hello, 

1. Instaling project can be made by running command "npm install" in main directory. 
2. After the instalation is finished command "npm start" will start the project. 

Project was build with Formik library wich makes creating forms in react a little less painful. 
Validation was performed with yup package, which is light-weight and pretty simple to use.
Styling the application was performed with styled-components. 

Enjoy,
Wojtek
